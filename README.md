## Know our project

The restaurant service improvement system, named Spiser, is a project developed to obtain the diploma of the technical course of ETEC Raposo Tavares.<br/>
Spiser Manager is the second application developed for this project. <br/>
It aims to manage all the needs of a restaurant:
<br/>- Track orders;
<br/>- View the customer record and information relevant to them (Name, email, how many orders the customer placed and how much was spent by him);
<br/>- Register and edit products and categories.
<br/> All of these functions can be performed by the establishment's customers directly from their smartphones, in a clean, fluid and easy-to-use interface.
